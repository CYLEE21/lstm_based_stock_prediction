# lstm_stock_prediction_master_thesis
This is the repo for my master's thesis using LSTM-based models and sentment analysis.

Duration: 5 months

Languages: Python

Top used libraries: Keras, PyTorch, pandas, numpy, selenium.

IDE: VScode, Windows 10, Mac OS, git

## Project objectives

Objective: Verify whether using relavant business news sentiment analysis can improve the stock prediction.

Dataset: (1) Several gas & oil corporations (xom, cvx, cop, eog, slb, ) stock prices information from 2013.01 to 2022.11, (2) Business news collected from Google news from 2013.01 to 2022.11.

Models: (1) Stacked LSTM, (2) Attention-LSTM, (3) Conv1d-LSTM, (4) FinBERT (Bert-transformer)

Results: Business news sentiment analysis **will improve** the stock prediction.
